# Gomensoro_respirometer
Scripts and files to download and handle according to default respirometer equations (ÂµTrac 4200, Sy Lab microbiology, Gomensoro) from resistivity (M) to respiration units (mgCO2/gSOIL/h).

There is a metadata file to understand the meaning of the columns in the output file once used the code.

To use on your own device you must follow the next steps:
  1) Create a folder named "Respiracion" on the "C:" route
  2) Put your .txt respiration raw data on the route "C:\Respiracion"
  3) Run the code, the output file with a .csv extension will be paced directly on the route "C:\Respiracion"
  4) Enjoy :)
